# Booking RDV script
Booking script for naturalisation RDV of Yvelines prefecture using Python and Selenium.

The script will try to load the RDV page each 1 minute until a RDV is available. 

When a RDV page is available a sound notification will be triggered and then you have to manually continue finishing the steps of your rendezvous.

The script could be used for other prefectures website with small changes.
